## Overall Design Philosophy
The `Interpreter` class in my code instantiates and integrates the various components, which collectively enable the interpreter to load, validate, and execute a program in the parsed XML representation of IPPcode23 code.

The codebase employs the singleton design pattern for implementing several classes that oversee distinct areas of an interpreter. The following classes are implemented:
* **ArgParser** for parsing command line arguments
* **FrameManager** for handling frames
* **FlowManager** for handling control flow
* **IOManager** for handling input and output
* **StackManager** for handling the data stack
* **InstructionFactory** for generating instructions

### Execution of Instructions
`interpret()` method of the `Interpreter` class executes the program instructions in order. To dynamically generate the appropriate instruction objects based on the current opcode, it uses an `InstructionFactory`. Each instruction is executed with the appropriate requirements.

### Program Arguments
The `ArgParser` class parses command line arguments. It saves the files as attributes of the class for further use.

## Source XML Parsing
The program utilizes the `xml.etree.ElementTree` library and uses its parse and fromstring methods to load the input XML source file as an `ElementTree` object, which is then traversed to extract information about the program's structure.

## Instruciton Class and Its Subclasses
The `Instruction` class and its subclasses are designed to work together to provide a complete set of instructions for the interpreted language. The `Instruction` class is an abstract base class for implementing individual instructions of the language. There are subclasses for all instructions of the IPPcode23 language, they implement the `execute(self, **params)` abstract method.

### Instruction Factory
The `InstructionFactory` class contains a dictionary specifying which instruction reqiures which resources. The class has a generation method:  
`gen(self, ins)` takes an XML instruction element *ins* and returns an instance of the corresponding instruction class.

## Resource Management
The resource managers are designed to systematically manage all resources in a structured way. The managers constitute a comprehensive solution for resource handling.

### Frame Manager
**Frame** is a structure in which variables and their values are stored. `Frame` class uses python dictionary like a hashtable to implement the functionality. The following methods are defined:  
`defvar(self, name)` declares a variable with the given *name*,  
`save(self, name, value)` saves the *value* into frame\[*name*\],  
`getVal(self, name)` returns the value of the variable with the given *name*.

The `FrameManager` class manages the frames - global (`GF`), local (`LF`), and temporary (`TF`). `GF` and `TF` are instances of `Frame` class and `LF` is a list of its instances that is used like a stack. The manager contains several methods to manipulate the frames:  
`pushframe(self)` appends `TF` to `LF` and clears `TF`,  
`popframe(self)` removes the top instance in `LF` and saves it to `TF`,  
`createframe(self)` instantiates new `Frame` class to `TF`,  
`getVal(self, var)` returns the value of a variable *var*,  
`getFrame(self, var)` splits *var* that is in format *'frame@name'* into *frame* and *name*, and returns them,  
`currentLF(self)` is used like property; returns the top `Frame` instace in `LF`.

### Flow Manager
The `FlowManager` class manages the succession of instructions by keeping track of the "instruction pointer" (`ip`) which represents the order of the instruction being executed. It also contains `_labels` dictionary and a `_callstack` list that is used like a stack. Upon initialization, the class stores the order of each label in a dictionary. It implements these methods to control the flow:  
`jump(self, label)` sets `ip` to the order of *label*,  
`call(self, label)` appends the order of *label* to the `_callstack` and jumps to *label*,  
`ret(self)` removes the top of the `_callstack` and jumps to it.

### Input and Output Manager
The `IOManager` class is used to manage input (from `stdin`) and output (to both `stdout` and `stderr`). When initialized, it opens the *input file* for reading; and it is closed in destructor. The following methods are defined:  
`readOne(self)` reads and returns a single line of input stripped of any trailing whitespace,  
`read(self)` reads and returns text from standard input until EOF,  
`write(self, message, isError = 0)` writes *message* to standard output; if optional parameter *isError* will be evaluated as True, it outputs to the standard error instead. Additionally, it parses escape sequences.

### Stack Manager
The `StackManager` class uses a list called `stack` as a stack data structure. The `stack` itself is stored as a static variable within the class. The class provides two methods:  
`push(symb)` adds *symb* to the top of the `stack`,  
`pop()` returns and removes the top of the `stack`.
